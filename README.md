# A personal home library organizer.

## *What is the application's goal?*

This interactive application will focus on helping the user **track their reading progress**.
The application will take information from the user about their currently owned books,
and work towards setting up a personalized reading goal and helping users achieve it by 
recommending a book to read from their list. 

This application is aimed towards users who may have an existing(and growing) library 
collection and find it challenging to keep a track of what books they have read and what 
books may be pending. 

This project is of interest to me because I have faced this challenge myself. I currently 
own nearly 210 books and keeping a track of what I yet have to read, is difficult!
Sometimes I end up buying more new books without realizing I still have a couple of books
to read. So I wanted to create an application that can help users track their reading
progress and help motivate them to read books from their library.


## *User Stories*

The following points below some up what **user tasks** and **functionalities** would be 
achieved with this application. 

- As a user, I want to be able to ***create my own book list*** consisting of 
currently owned books in my library.
- As a user, I want to be able to ***add any newly purchased books*** to my book list.
- As a user, I want to be able to ***check off*** which books I have already read.
- As a user, I want to be able to ***set a goal*** of what books I would like to read 
in my fixed amount of time.
- As a user, I want the application to ***randomly suggest a book per week*** for me to read.
- As a user, I want to be able to ***track my reading progress*** by viewing what books 
I have read, and what is pending.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my list of books ***sorted by title or author***.
- As a user, I want the option to ***save my current reading list*** when I quit the application.
- As a user, I want the option to ***reload my saved reading list*** from previous use, 
when I start the application.

**Phase 4: Task 2:**
I have chosen the option 'Make appropriate use of the Map interface somewhere in your code. '
**Classes:** UserAccount, BookApp
**Method:** initMap() in UserAccount, mark() in BookApp

**Phase 4: Task 3:**
Looking through my code, and the UML diagram, I would refactor the following:
- My BookApp and GUI class contains a lot of repeated code with finding book item in list. I would 
extract this as a separate method to improve readability and reduce redundant lines of code.
- I would also create a separate the GUI class into UIDesign class and panel class
to improve maintainability of the user interface for the future.
