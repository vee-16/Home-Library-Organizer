# A personal home library organizer.

## *What is the application's goal?*

This interactive application will focus on helping the user **track their reading progress**.
The application will take information from the user about their currently owned books,
and work towards setting up a personalized reading goal and helping users achieve it by 
recommending a book to read from their list. 

This application is aimed towards users who may have an existing(and growing) library 
collection and find it challenging to keep a track of what books they have read and what 
books may be pending. 

This project is of interest to me because I have faced this challenge myself. I currently 
own nearly 210 books and keeping a track of what I yet have to read, is difficult!
Sometimes I end up buying more new books without realizing I still have a couple of books
to read. So I wanted to create an application that can help users track their reading
progress and help motivate them to read books from their library.
